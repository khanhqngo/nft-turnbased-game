# nft-turnbased-game

This is a fork project code for the NFT turn-based game from the buildspace program. I added a few comments as a summary of instructions from this project for future revision. You might find the game is clunky and so I suggest you should look at other learners' codes for further exploration, or even find the original source code from buildspace for reference.

Luckily, I worked through the whole program and earned the NFT for completing this project. You can take a look at it here: https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x3CD266509D127d0Eac42f4474F57D0526804b44e/18021 

Happy building and have a great day!
